## Reflection Questions
1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here.

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words) 

The most challenging thing I encountered while making this project was resizing the pictures to fit within the square button. 
In my project, I added images that are hidden but when the button is pressed, it is revealed. 
I went and found images of funny faces, but it seemed like every time I linked it to the buttons, the pictures would be way too zoomed in or it would be too small. 
I looked for software to help resizing but realized that I had Microsoft paint installed. I went to Microsoft paint and resized the image width and height to a value I thought would fit. 
I uploaded it and linked it in the CSS file and found out that it did not fit. I repeated this cycle 5 times for each image until both images fit. This process took trial and error and was time consuming. 
However, I was able to overcome this challenge because I was determined to fit the picture within the square button. I knew that this would be an addition that would spruce up the game and make it more unique. 
In the end, it did make the game funnier and more interesting than before.

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words) 

Some questions I had regarding web development was that how would libraries such as React JS further improve my website? 
How do frameworks play a role within websites?  How important is SQL to web development? How many libraries does it take to create a website suitable for companies and other organizations?
How are libraries and frameworks created?
Does web development consist of both front-end and back-end or either or? 
How can Python be used for back-end development?
Is C or C++ widely used in back-end development?
Are languages like R used in back-end developmennt or are they avoided in favor of more well known languages?

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words) 

If I had more time, I would have tried to add more color and animation to the header and paragraph text. 
That would have made the page look exciting and colorful. I also would have added four more buttons to make it ten total buttons. 
That would make the game very confusing and difficult because the user has to remember which button was lit up and when there are that many buttons, it gets difficult. 
I definitely would’ve added a clock which ticks down the number of seconds a user has to guess the pattern. 
I also would’ve added custom animal noise tunes to each button in order to customize it as that would make the project funny and interesting.
